## Dotvim

These are my dotvim files that I use in my daily development. I have for long used a modified version of
spf13 with heavy customizations on top of it. But with time, it felt a bit sluggish and heavy. So decided
to start my .vimrc from scratch. The following config is a direct result of this. It feels very fast and it
is fun to write code in my Vim again. Hope you enjoy it and if you do, you can tip me here at https://gratipay.com/vinitkme/. Thanks! :)

## Installation:

In order to install the latest version:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:vinitkumar/.vim.git
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
cd .vim
cp vimrc ~/.vimrc
vim +BundleInstall +qall

## You also need to copy colors into vim directory, and here I personally use RailsCasts
```

git checkout origin/master-old
